Software Quality Management Plan: Zoom

Part A – Company and System Research

Organization: Zoom Video Communications, Inc. is a cloud-based videoconferencing software, founded by Eric Yuan in 2011. Zoom, its flagship product, allows for online video meetings, webinars and messaging across desktop and mobile platforms. The system’s scope contains features such as HD audio and video conferencing, screen sharing and recording. These features make it appealing to a variety of customer base, ranging from individual users to large enterprises, relying on Zoom for daily meetings and communication. Key stakeholders include business professionals, educators, students, private companies and government organizations. High quality needs to be prioritized as any security or reliability issues can disrupt remote work and learning for millions.

Quality Challenges
- Security and Privacy Issues: Zooms calls were not truly end-to-end encrypted and initially lacked proper safeguards, leading to incidents called “Zoom bombing” (uninvited people disturbing the meeting, often with offensive content) (Hamilton, 2020a). These incidents affected the users’ trust on the application and even prompted institutions such as the U.S. Senate and Taiwan’s government to restrict Zoom’s use over security concerns (Hamilton, 2020b). Reputation was damaged and multiple urgent legal scrutiny followed as a consequence of poor security quality of the application.
- Scalability and Reliability After the Sudden Growth: Zoom’s infrastructure was affected by the sudden 1900% surge in traffic in the early 2020 (Hamilton, 2020b). In order to avoid outages during the surge, Zoom had to increase the server capacity via cloud providers. Despite the unprecedented load, Zoom’s quality challenges were to maintain near perfect uptime and call quality as failure in doing so will halt business operations and online classes in the millions.
- Ease-of-Use and Security tradeoff: Zoom’s initial frictionless meeting (joining via a simple link) came at the cost of security defaults. Not requiring passwords and waiting rooms made “Zoom bombing” possible. This brought up a quality challenge: usability being prioritized over security which Zoom needed to adjust to by adding security features such as passwords and meeting locks without heavily affected Zoom’s hallmark ease of use.
